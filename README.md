# Destroy 1 Show 2

"Destroy 1 Show 2" is a simple yet addictive browser-based game created using a custom programming language called HTH (HeavenToHell). The game showcases the capabilities of HTH by transpiling its code into JavaScript and embedding it into an HTML file.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to click on the buttons that appear on the screen. Each time you click a button, it disappears, and two new buttons are randomly spawned in different positions. The game continues until the screen is filled with buttons, and there's only one available position left.

## Features

- Dynamic button generation based on screen size
- Random button positioning without overlapping
- Custom algorithm for generating unique random positions
- Win condition detection and message box display
- Times the user and shows the best time
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used
